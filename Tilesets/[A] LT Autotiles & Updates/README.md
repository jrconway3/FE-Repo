## Lex Talionis Tileset Support

### Why is this here?

This category has been added to support certain tilesets with Lex Talionis, including autotiles as well as having full tileset sheets made with each palette of a given asset. I won't be creating assets in here unless either I can confirm the tileset is F2E or if I have express permission from the original artist.

Originally I added this as a subcategory of an existing tileset, but it accidentally got removed after an update. So I decided to make its own main category. It seems like this is where other similar "miscellaneous" tileset updates go.
